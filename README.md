My individual project for data science (COMP 3125).

## Abstract
Mental health is a topic people tend to shy away from, especially in the workplace. This project aimed to dive into how workplace factors impact an employeeâ€™s mental health and their attitudes towards it. Two datasets were used to find answers: An ongoing Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) survey starting in 2016 and a Gallup survey taken in 2022. A Python notebook was used to analyze the data, build a machine learning (ML) model, and visualize results. In the end, several conclusions were made regarding mental health in the workplace and around the world.

## Data
Within the data folder, the two CSV files were used in the code: 
- 'mental-heath-in-tech-2016_20161114'
- 'Statistic_id1376336-Data-to-CSV'

The remaining excel file 'statistic_id1376336_impact-of-jobs-on-mental-health-according-to-employees-in-the-us-as-of-2022-by-age' is the original Statista data file.
